# Knapsack-
The knapsack problem is indeed a fundamental problem in optimization and constraint programming. It serves as a classic example to illustrate various techniques, including greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and constraint programming.
# Variables:
    Let n be the number of items.
    Let W be the maximum capacity of the knapsack.
    Let w[i] be the weight of item i.
    Let p[i] be the profit/value of item i.
# Constraints:
    The sum of the weights of the selected items must not exceed the capacity of the backpack.
# Objective Function:
    Maximize the total value of the selected objects, by adding the values ​​of the objects based on the binary variables.
